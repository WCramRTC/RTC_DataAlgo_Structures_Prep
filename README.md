### Big O Notation
**Big O Notation** is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, often used in computer science to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm.

### Recursion
**Recursion** is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In programming, recursion involves functions that call themselves.

### Search Algorithms

1. **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks every element in the list until the desired element is found or the list ends.

2. **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

3. **Binary Search Tree**: A tree data structure where each node has at most two children, used for efficient searching, inserting, and deleting operations.

### Sorting Algorithms

1. **Selection Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm, where the smallest element is selected from the unsorted part and swapped with the leftmost element.

2. **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

3. **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

4. **Merge Sort**: An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

### Data Structures

1. **Lists**: A collection of elements, characterized by a sequence and the operations of traversal, insertion, and deletion.

2. **Linked List**: A linear data structure where each element is a separate object, with each element comprising of data and a reference to the next element in the sequence.

3. **Binary Trees**: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
   - [Binary Trees on Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/)
   
4. **Queue**: A linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
   - [Queue on Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/)
   
5. **Stack**: A linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is Last In First Out (LIFO).
   - [Stack on Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/)
   
6. **Hash Tables**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
